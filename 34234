I've been painting every fence I know <br/>
Every color bleeds into the same <br/>
'Cause before you go and walk away <br/>

Yeah, you better know where you're going

You're a wanderer, just like me
Hey ya, hey ya

My heart rages around like an ocean in my head <br/>

Because there are so many things that i left unsaid <br/><br/>

I can almost feel you walking in the distance 
<br/>
But i know that is not reality
<br/>
If you are like going around inside this parallel conventions all along
Know i'll find you in my dreams
<br/> <br/>

My heart rages around like an ocean in my head
